    <description>Field Created per SFDC Case = 00622963. 

Boris has asked the AE team to develop plans on migrating AE accounts off of High-Risk Services. Since we are doing account plans for all AE accounts, we want to be able to track this as we are doing account plans.

To support AE focus on migrating High Risk Services (e.g., Centrex), we would like a check-box on the Account Record. Field Name = Has High Risk Services

The field should be placed on the page layout directly above or below the fields Account Plan Segment and Account Plan Type.

Same field level security and accessibility as the Account Plan Type and Segment fields.</description>
